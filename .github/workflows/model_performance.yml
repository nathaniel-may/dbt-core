# **what?**
# This workflow models the performance characteristics of a point in time in dbt.
# It runs specific dbt commands on committed projects multiple times to create and
# commit information about the distribution to the current branch. For more information
# see the readme in the performance module at /performance/README.md.
#
# **why?**
# When developing new features, we can take quick performance samples and compare
# them against the commited baseline measurements produced by this workflow to detect
# some performance regressions at development time before they reach users.
#
# **when?**
# This is only run once directly after each release. If for some reason the results of
# a run are not satisfactory, it can also be triggered manually.
